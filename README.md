## Challenges
- just actually playing audio: I experimented with using Howler. I was able to get it work, but it wasn't perfect. I'd have to create a whole custom audio player in addition. That's why I just went with the audio tag. A whole audio controller is made for you, and it's a lot easier to use. 
- styling the audio player: figuring out how to grab the element
- using cloudinary to store online mp3 links
- edit the entire schema to include the mp3 URL....
